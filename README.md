# Lina
Lina is an AAR/AEA app for iOS using my [libNeoAppleArchive](https://github.com/0xilis/libNeoAppleArchive) library. While libNeoAppleArchive is made in C, Lina is made in Swift and UIKit.

# Why Lina?

Backend library powering Lina is libNeoAppleArchive, my open source library for Apple Archive.

libNeoAppleArchive = LNAA, LNAA sounds like Lina, so I chose Lina.

# Planned

This app is planned to be on the App Store, and I may distribute TestFlight links soon!

- Add credits section
- Make app actually work
- Add AEA decryption
- Add AEA formation; the first TestFlight build doesn't need to support all AEA types but it should support at least AEAProfile 0. On the App Store we want to support all types however.
- Add Siri Shortcut actions
