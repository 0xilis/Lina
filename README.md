# Lina
Lina is an AAR/AEA app for iOS using my [libNeoAppleArchive](https://github.com/0xilis/libNeoAppleArchive) library. While libNeoAppleArchive is made in C, Lina is made in Swift and UIKit.

# Why Lina?

Backend library powering Lina is libNeoAppleArchive, my open source library for Apple Archive.

libNeoAppleArchive = LNAA, LNAA sounds like Lina, so I chose Lina.
