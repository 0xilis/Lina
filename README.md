# Lina
Lina is an AAR/AEA app for iOS using my [libNeoAppleArchive](https://github.com/0xilis/libNeoAppleArchive) library. While libNeoAppleArchive is made in C, Lina is made in Swift and UIKit.

# Why Lina?

Backend library powering Lina is libNeoAppleArchive, my open source library for Apple Archive.

libNeoAppleArchive = LNAA, LNAA sounds like Lina, so I chose Lina.

# Planned

This app is planned to be on the App Store. Please DM/Contact me for a TestFlight link!

- Figure out how to make "Show When Run" for the shortcuts action not appear and default to false.
- Support for all AEA profiles, but this is not planned until a later update on the App Store and will not be in the first release.
