# Lina
Lina is an AAR/AEA app for iOS using my [libNeoAppleArchive](https://github.com/0xilis/libNeoAppleArchive) library. While libNeoAppleArchive is made in C, Lina is made in Swift and UIKit.

# Why Lina?

Backend library powering Lina is libNeoAppleArchive, my open source library for Apple Archive.

libNeoAppleArchive = LNAA, LNAA sounds like Lina, so I chose Lina.

# Features

- Creating Apple Archives
- Extracting Apple Archives
- Creating Apple Encrypted Archives (Currently only AEAProfile 0)
- Extracting Apple Encrypted Archives (Currently only AEAProfile 0)
- Share Sheet Integration
- Create AAR Siri Shortcut Action
- Extract AAR Siri Shortcut Action

# Planned

This app is planned to be on the App Store. Please DM/Contact me for a TestFlight link!

- Support 100% AEA; currently in this build we only support AEAProfile 0. This is fine for TestFlight builds but once we get on the App Store we want to support all types however, or at least AEAProfile 1.
- Support all compression types for AAR/AEA (this is a libNeoAppleArchive thing, not Lina)
- Add Siri Shortcut actions for AEA
